    <h1>Dress like Toji</h1>
    <img src="./HTML_photos/Tojifit.jpeg" class="responsive-img">
    <p class="para">Black Tight-Fitting Short-Sleeve Shirt
        A classic compression or athletic-fit tee made of stretchy, moisture-wicking fabric (usually polyester/spandex blend). It hugs the torso and arms like a second skin, showing maximum muscle definition while staying tucked in during movement. Popular in combat sports, calisthenics, and streetwear for its clean, aggressive “no excess fabric” look.</p>
    <p class="para">White Oversized Harem / Fisherman / Aladdin Pants
Extremely baggy, low-crotch pants with elastic or drawstring waist and cinched ankles. Usually made of lightweight cotton, linen, or rayon. Originally traditional Thai, Middle-Eastern, or martial-arts wear, they give total freedom for high kicks, deep squats, sprinting, and grappling. The exaggerated drop-crotch and volume make legs look even bigger when the fabric is still and create that signature “ninja/assassin” silhouette.</p>
<p class="para">Long Black Fabric Belt / Sash
A wide, soft cloth belt (similar to a martial-arts obi or kung-fu sash) tied around the waist and left to hang down the front. Serves both practical (keeps the loose pants secure) and stylistic purposes — the long hanging end adds dramatic movement when running or fighting and screams “traditional warrior” vibe.</p>
<p class="para">Black Low-Top Sneakers (Nike Blazer-style in the render)
Simple, flat-soled, minimalist sneakers. Chosen for grip, ankle mobility, and the ability to feel the ground — perfect for explosive sprints, jumps, and quick direction changes without the bulk of high-top boots. The all-black color keeps the outfit stealthy and menacing.</p>
